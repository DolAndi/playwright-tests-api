# playwright-tests-backend

This repository contains a comprehensive set of backend automated tests for the ServeRest API, accessible at https://serverest.dev/. Utilizing the powerful Playwright framework in combination with TypeScript, I've developed precise and efficient tests covering a wide range of API scenarios.

## Key Features:

### Automated Backend Testing: 
Focused on backend testing to ensure the integrity and performance of the ServeRest API.
### Playwright and TypeScript: 
Uses Playwright for API test automation, offering fast and reliable test execution, and TypeScript for safer and more maintainable code.
### Comprehensive Coverage: 
Tests cover authentication, CRUD operations, and schema validations, ensuring all aspects of the API are thoroughly tested.
### Flexible Configuration: 
Easily adaptable setup for different testing environments.
### Detailed Reporting: 
Generates HTML reports for easy analysis of test results.
This project is ideal for those looking to implement a robust automated testing solution for APIs, using best practices and modern development tools.
